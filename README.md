### Purpose
In times of WordPress, Wix, etc., handcrafted website have become almost a rarity. We want to share our efforts with any webdesign enthusiast out there. Get inspired, re-use our code, contribute with your improvals. 
Though putting much effort keeping the code clean and readable, you might find yourself having a hard time digging throught all of it. If you have any questions regarding this project, feel free to ask me.
There's still a lot of documentation to be done, and code to be cleaned up. 

### Tech

ATM our code requires the following browser capabilities in order to be run and displayed as intended. 

* convincing HTML5 support
* css3
* ECMAScript6 (2015)

A detailed list of required browser capabilities and must-support features is planned to be added soon.


### Dependencies

Our project uses [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) to generate css files.
This project comes with it's own little "js framework", which essentially emerged during project development. 

### Usage

Feel free to re-use this code in whichever kind you can think of. You do not need to mention us in any way. However, feel free to send us a link to your project. We would love to see how you could make use of our work.

This repo lacks any images used on our website and refered to in the source. Just replace these these with your images.
